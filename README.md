# # Brief Introduction about project

# In this project I have collected data of last 3 years in a csv(comma separated values) file, furthur I have cleaned the file and attempted to get insights from it. I have built this project in python and using various libraries such as pandas, numpy and matplotlib.  
# Dataset details:
# This dataset has funding information of the Indian startups from January 2015 to August 2017.
# Feature Details :
# SNo - Serial number.
# Date - Date of funding in format DD/MM/YYYY.
# StartupName - Name of the startup which got funded.
# IndustryVertical - Industry to which the startup belongs.

# CityLocation - City which the startup is based out of.
# InvestorsName - Name of the investors involved in the funding round.
# InvestmentType - Either Private Equity or Seed Funding.
# AmountInUSD - Funding Amount in USD.

# # Libraries used

# NumPy:Stands for numerical python. It is basically used for creating n-dimensional array and it has various inbuilt functions which make development easy. 
# 
# Pandas:It is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.
# 
# Matplotlib:It is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shells, the Jupyter notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits.
# Matplotlib tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible. You can generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, errorcharts, scatterplots, etc., with just a few lines of code.
